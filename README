Telnet chat server by Joseph Benkual June 2015

This server uses nodejs

To access the server you can use the telnet command and pass in the ip address and port of the host server.

Example: Telnet 127.0.0.1 8888

You can change which port used in the config file, as well as the database info and other settings

Here is a list of commands the client can use.
quit - disconnects from server
/register - creates a new account
/join - enters a chatroom (by default this also creates a new room if necessary)
/leave - exits a chatroom
/create - creates a chatroom
