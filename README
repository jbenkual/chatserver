Telnet chat server by Joseph Benkual June 2015

This server uses nodejs

To access the server you can use the telnet command and pass in the ip address and port of the host server.

Example: Telnet 127.0.0.1 8888

You can change which port used in the config file, as well as the database info and other settings

Here is a list of commands the client can use.
/quit - disconnects from server
/join - enters an existing room
/leave - exits a chatroom
/create roomName password - creates a chatroom where you are the owner

ToDo:
/register username email password - creates a new account
/promote username - creates a moderator for the current chatroom (owners only)
/demote username - removes moderator privelages (owners only)
/kick - removes a user from a room (moderators only)
/ban days - prevents a user from entering a room for # of days (moderators only)
/globalban days - prevents a user from logging in for # of days (admin only)
