Once installed,

cd chatserver

node server

To access the server you can use the telnet command and pass in the ip address and port of the host server.

Example: Telnet 127.0.0.1 8888

You can change which port used in the config file, as well as the database info and other settings

Here is a list of commands the client can use.
/quit - disconnects from server
/list - shows a list of existing rooms
/join - enters an existing room
/leave - exits a chatroom
/create roomName password - creates a chatroom. If you provide a password, you become the owner

ToDo:
/register username email password - creates a new account
/promote username - creates a moderator for the current chatroom (owners only)
/demote username - removes moderator privelages (owners only)
/kick - removes a user from a room (moderators only)
/ban days - prevents a user from entering a room for # of days (moderators only)
/globalban days - prevents a user from logging in for # of days (admin only)
